    "I said he grazed me. I hardly feel anything." Though from the crowd that was gathering around them, Gavin was getting worried. He looked at his forearm and noticed the tear in his leather jacket, bits of his black, long-sleeved shirt peeking through from the damage. There were smudges of blue—

    Blue?

    He yanked his arm out of his jacket and rolled up his sleeve, soaked from a bleeding wound he didn't feel. But instead of blotches of red staining his skin, it was blue. Streaks of it trailed down his hand and onto his fingertips, droplets falling to the floor in dark and vivid circles of sapphire.

    "What the fuck?!" Gavin stepped away from the mess he was making on the floor. "What the fuck is <em>this</em>?"

    "Thirium," Connor said. "Detective Reed, I didn't know you were an android."

    Or, an alternate summary:

    A fic about a human who's bad at being an android, an android who's bad at being human, a human who's bad at being human, and a human who learns what it means to be human. Oh, some of them are family but not, someone's probably dead but not, and existential crises set to a backdrop of a dumpster fire called Trying To Get Humans And Androids To Just Shut Up And Coexist.

    summary: `
    The DBH Convenience Store AU sitcom that no one asked for (except maybe one person), featuring Gavin Reed as your tired, underpaid, hooked-on-stale-convenience-store-coffee cashier; and Hank Anderson as your tired, underpaid, I-run-three-stores-and-I-hate-my-life night manager. Includes their nuisances/customers during a midnight mart run: Connor, the why-the-fuck-are-you-so-happy-at-this-hour insomniac grad student working on his dissertation (or is secretly a government agent, or a vampire, they haven't agreed yet); Tina and Chris, two Taco Bell employees that engage in illicit deals to trade tacos for fountain drinks; Perkins, a crotchety nicotine addict that deserves to be brought through the ringer of "it's company policy"; among many others that may or may not make it into this collection.

    Yes, this is a disaster. Yes, Hank and Gavin are not happy about it.

    "I'm sorry," someone said. Another clang. "I'm sorry I couldn't... help you."

    Gavin pushed himself away from where he leaned against the food stall and went to the other side to investigate. Someone else was also at the Chicken Feed, fists balled up against the wall, head low and out of sight. A jacket that had a glowing triangle, "RK800" printed cleanly underneath it.

    Android.

    Not just any android, but the lieutenant's android. Connor.

    Gavin went up to it, grabbing it by the shoulders and turning it around to face him. "Why the fuck are <em>you</em> here?"

    Takes place after events of a post-peaceful/pacifist ending with a deviant!Connor, but Connor and Hank were hostile to each other.
