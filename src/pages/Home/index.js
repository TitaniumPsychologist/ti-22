      <p>Hello, and welcome to my humble little homepage where I've decided to dump all the links to relevant information to find me and my stuff. Expect really bad coding practices (there's a lot of mess if you open the dev tools for your browser ðŸ˜‰), and my constant struggle with trying to get CSS to work. This is an ongoing project and if it looks bad and incomplete it's because it is lol</p>
    </main>

export default Home;
