        Welcome!
      </h1>
      <p className="py-2">Hello, and welcome to my humble little homepage where I've decided to dump all the links to relevant information to find me and my stuff. Expect really bad coding practices (there's a lot of mess if you open the dev tools for your browser ðŸ˜‰), and my constant struggle with trying to get CSS to work. This is an ongoing project and if it looks bad and incomplete it's because it is lol</p>
      <p className="py-2">Anyway, this is so not finished yet, but I wanted something to have links to where else you can find me so yeah.</p>
      <p className="py-2">And for those interested, website version 1.0 can be found on <a className="text-emphasis hover-text-blue" href="https://titaniumpsychologist.github.io/homepage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://titaniumpsychologist.github.io/homepage/</a></p>
