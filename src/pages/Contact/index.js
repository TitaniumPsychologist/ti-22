        <p className="py-2">For quick updates and occasional glimpses into my head, you can find me on <a className="text-green" href="https://twitter.com/ti22psych" target='_blank' rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a>. Includes a general time window for a next update for a fic I'm working on, though no promises that I will adhere to it since I tend to be pretty busy with other stuff lately. My DMs are open!</p>
        <p className="py-2">For longer updates and occasional "deleted scenes" and my attempts at drawing art, you can find me on <a className="text-green" href="https://titaniumpsychologist.tumblr.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tumblr</a>. Feel free to shoot me an ask or a message if you'd like!</p>
        <p className="py-2">To see the kinds of stuff I like to discuss, you can find me on <a className="text-green" href="https://www.reddit.com/user/titaniumPsychologist/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Reddit</a>. Again, direct messages are open!</p>
        <p className="py-2"><strong>Note:</strong> I do have DMs enabled on these accounts, however I do have a tendency to block for spam, as well as discussions that veer on the side of NSFW. It's nothing personal, I assure you. I just prefer to keep those kinds of discussions to people I know IRL. Other than that, feel free to say hi!</p>
